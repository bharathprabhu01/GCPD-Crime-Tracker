        <p> Our privacy policy is simple. All officer information is highly
            classified and strictly confidential. Most officers can see all 
            information about themselves but cannot edit all parts of this information. 
            Most officers also only have read-only access to information from other 
            officers. The only people who are allowed to change or add 
            information are the Unit Chiefs and Commissioner Gordon.
          <br><br>
          It's really that simple.
